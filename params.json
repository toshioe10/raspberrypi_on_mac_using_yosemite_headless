And now what?\r\n\r\nAs a teacher, or anybody else without computer skills (like me), you need to setup and perform the Os installation.\r\n\r\nThis guide is a simple guide made for you. No blah blah bla, no bullshit.\r\n\r\nIf you use Windows Os, I suggest you to check out [Meltwater's guide](http://pihw.wordpress.com/guides/direct-network-connection/) For Linux Os, the following guide is quite similar to mac. In this example, it is used a Macbook Pro 13\" mid2010 with Mac Os Yosemite (10.10), a graphical SDcard builder[Apple-Pi-Baker v1.6 , 3.6MB released on June 26, 2014.](http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/raspberry-pi/macosx-apple-pi-baker/), Iphone power supply and a wirelless-router.\r\n\r\nWhat you need:\r\n\r\n1.  5V microUSB power supply. [According Official website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs), Model B+ boards are slightly more power efficient and its circuits requires between 600-2000mA (0.6-2.0A). Electric-current requirements relies on what you connect to it. As [reference](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs), 1200mA (1.2A) are enough for most applicattions, including this one!\r\n2.  a network cable\r\n3.  a laptop or computer with ethernet port avaliable (RJ-45). If your internet access is done via cable, in this case you need an extra ethernet card.\r\n4.  a microSDcard at least class 4 with minimum 8GB\r\n5.  a copy of Raspbian downloaded at [official Raspberry website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).\r\n6.  setup your SSH conectivity, on your laptop/computer. Since you use a Mac, you are ready to go.\r\n7.  Optional: In this guide, I used a wireless-router and attached the Raspeberry Pi. However, the router is not needed.\r\n\r\nStep1: Preparation\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nInsert the microSD card into laptop. Now download and install any of these graphical interface: [ApplePi-Baker(free, closed-source, 3.6MB](http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/raspberry-pi/macosx-apple-pi-baker/) or [PiWriter(free, open-source)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/piwriter/), or [Pi Filler](http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/).\r\n\r\nOpen the choosen graphical interface card builder and following the procedures. If You choose Apple-Pi-Baker:\r\n\r\n-   Select the microSD card (step 1 as shown in the figure bellow), and hit \"Prep for NOOBS\" button (step 2 as shown in the figure bellow).\r\n-   After wait a little bit, its time to build the image into microSD card. Click \"Restore Backup\" button (step 3 as shown in the figure bellow) and choose the image you saved(step 4 as shown in the figure bellow).The build process should begin.\r\n-   When it's done, remove graphical interface SDcard buider, you don't need it anymore.\r\n-->![alt text](https://github.com/toshioe10/raspberrypi_on_mac_using_yosemite_headless/blob/master/img/Apple-Pi-Baker-steps.png)\r\nStep2: Edit installation files\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.  Open the SDcard, copy the `cmdline.txt` file and rename it to `cmdline.normal`\r\n2.  Launch terminal and type `ifconfig` command to get your laptop IP address. In my case, it is `192.168.2.102`\r\n3.  Open cmdline.txt and give to the raspeberry a local ip address, modifying just the last number's sequence, someting like:\r\n   `ip=192.168.1.XXX`, where XXX will be the Raspberry's IP address you just gave.\r\n4.  Save it, make one more copy, and rename it to `cmdline.direct`\r\n5.  Remove SDcard from laptop / computer and insert into Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nStep3: Making the first remote connection\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.  On Mac, go to System Preferences \\> Sharing and check the following options (You migt be asked for password):\r\n    -   File Sharing\r\n    -   Internet Sharing\r\n\r\n2.  Attach the network cable into wireless router and Raspberry Pi\r\n3.  Now it's time to power UP!\r\n4.  Wait a little bit, something like 30 seconds, launch Terminal (on Mac) and type `ssh -X` command, wich has thefollowing syntax: `ssh -X user@hostname`. In our example, just type and follow the instruction given by prompt:\r\n\r\n    > `              ssh -X pi@192.168.2.102         `\r\n    >  When asked for password just type\r\n    >  `             raspberry         `\r\n\r\nIt's done! Now you are connected to Raspberry Pi, and from here you are ready to go, installing [VNC](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/), setup internet config and so on!\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIf you want to setup the internet config:\r\n\r\n`$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`\r\n\r\nDelete its contents, and simply copy and paste:\r\n\r\n    auto eth0 \r\n    iface lo inet loopback \r\n\r\n    allow-hotplug wlan0 \r\n    iface eth0 inet dhcp \r\n    address 192.168.2.102 # Static IP you want \r\n    netmask 255.255.255.0 \r\n    gateway 192.168.2.1   # IP of your router\r\n\r\n    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\r\n    iface default inet dhcp\r\n\r\n*(ctrl-X, then type Y to quit and save)*\r\n\r\nThat's it. Maybe a reboot is required. Now the internet connection should be working. Congratulations!. If you want to setup a WiFi connection, you are almost done.\r\n\r\nAbout WiFi connection\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is not a step by step guide, just some hints that could be helpful. From previous wired connection it might be useful install [VNC](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/).\r\n\r\nYou will need to edit, at least, these files:\r\n `sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` \r\nand\r\n `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces` again, to something like\r\n```\r\n    auto lo\r\n\r\n    iface lo inet loopback\r\n    iface eth0 inet dhcp\r\n\r\n    auto wlan0\r\n    allow-hotplug wlan0\r\n    iface wlan0 inet dhcp\r\n    wpa-scan-ssid 1\r\n    wpa-ap-scan 1\r\n    wpa-key-mgmt XXXXXXXXSee bellow\r\n    wpa-proto XXXXXXXXX See bellow\r\n   wpa-pairwise CCMP TKIP\r\n   wpa-group CCMP TKIP\r\n   wpa-ssid \"Wifi SSID\"\r\n   wpa-psk \"wifi password\"\r\n   auth_alg=OPEN\r\n\r\n\r\n   iface default inet dhcp\r\n```\r\n\r\n-   `proto` could be either `RSN` (WPA2) or `WPA` (WPA1).\r\n-   `key_mgmt` could be either `WPA-PSK` (most probably) or `WPA-EAP` (enterprise networks)\r\n-   `pairwise` could be either `CCMP` (WPA2) or `TKIP` (WPA1)\r\n-   `auth_alg` is most probably `OPEN`, other options are `LEAP` and `SHARED`\r\n\r\nIf you boot Raspbian to desktop, you can launch the wpa\\_gui (WiFi config) application and click 'Scan'. You'll find a list that has your network with all flags you need. To do this on a RPi, disconnect your keyboard and connect your dongle once the scanning list is open.\r\n\r\nAgain: Wifi connection setup is just some hint. If you want to install VNC on Raspberry side:`sudo apt-get install tightvncserver`, and you should also install on your laptop, the client version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributors, Support or Contact\r\n[Eduardo Toshio](https://github.com/toshioe10)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
